Introduction.

The dns-discovery is a multi-threaded sub-domain brute-forcer,
is meant to be used by pen-testers during the initial stages.
Dns-discovery can resolve ipv4 and ipv6 sub-domains, for this, 
its uses a word-list provided by the user.
This was tested in GNU/Linux 2.6.38 and FreeBSD 8.1-STABLE.
Its similar to others tools, like dnsmap, but this is multi-threaded.
